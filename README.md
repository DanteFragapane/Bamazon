# Bamazon

A basic amazon replica made for class

## About the Project

This repo contains a project called "Bamazon," a basic, simple Amazon replica, containing only a few products and basic interactivity. This was made to demonstrate my knowledge of CLI concepts, and more importantly, my understanding of SQL and databases.

## How to get started

1. As always, run ``npm i`` in the root directory to install dependencies.
1. Run the ``schema.sql`` file in your chosen database application
1. Run the file using ``node bamazonCustomer.js``
